# AXOLOTI DIY

This is an unofficial DIY EAGLE Libary for the [Axoloti Core board](http://www.axoloti.com/). It is not authorised or approved by Axoloti.

First thing is a “Axoloti Shield Footprint”.

## TODO

- [ ] Verify and optimise footprint with Johannes
- [x] Add a example project with eagle .sch and .brd files without footprint to offer more flexibilty in connecting to the board. 
- [ ] Add more AXOLOTI HARDWARE HACK Resources to the document. (pinout documentation, examples,…)
